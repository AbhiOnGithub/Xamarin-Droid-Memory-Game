C# Xamarin-Droid-Memory-Game
This game is inspired by a Memory Game on Google Play. The Code is written from scratch in C#

Here is the Java based Memeory Game github repository

We can later apply Unity framework in it to enhance it more.

Feel free to get involved and enhance this app.
This app was just created to check the Xamarin Platform capabilities for gaming.
